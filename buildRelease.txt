1) download and install Python 2.7 from www.python.org

2) update install packages:
pip install --upgrade setuptools pip wheel twine

3) Build afdko package on:
Mac OSX with xcode tools installed
Windows 7 32 bit with Visual C++ installed
Windows 10 64 bit ( use copy of afdko dir tree after building on Windows 7).
Ubuntu Linux with build-essentials installed.

command:
cd <afdko package root directory>
rm dist/*
python setup.py bdist_wheel

4) Upload and test download with PyPi
a) release Pypi
twine upload dist/<wheel file>

b) test PyPi
twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple afdko

Inspect packages at web sites:
www.pypi.org
www.test.pypi.org

Notes:
 Added afdko command 'clean_afdko', which de-installs itself, including the
 command-line tools, with 'pip uninstall' does NOT do.
 
'twine upload dist/<wheel file>', when run for the first time for a new package, will handle registering a project.

test.pyi requires TLS protocol v1.2, which you can get on the Mac only by building python 2.7.14 from sources with brew:

brew install python

On my system, the command updated brew, then quit because I need Ruby > 2.0. The following worked to get Ruby.

# Get rvm
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
# quit terminal, the restart it, then use rvm to get ruby
rvm install ruby # download (2.4.1) and compile latest ruby. Needed a lot of packages.

# To see if you have TLS 1.2 say:
python -c "import requests; print(requests.get('https://www.howsmyssl.com/a/check', verify=False).json()['tls_version'])"

NOTE! brew does not overwrite the commands 'python", "pip", etc; it installs new versions with the the suffix '2' in /usr/local/bin. You need to fix these links yourself.
NOTE! To update the brew-installed Python, removing or updating packages requires user read/write access to '/usr/loca/bin/easy_install'. If you don't have this, then pip fails, but thinks it succeeded.
